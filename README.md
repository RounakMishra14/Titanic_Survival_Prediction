# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset encompasses various passenger attributes such as class, sex, age, and fare. Initial exploration reveals correlations between survival and factors like sex and passenger class, guiding subsequent feature engineering and model selection processes. Following preprocessing steps including handling missing values and categorical variable encoding, classification algorithms including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and AdaBoost are trained. Hyperparameter tuning via Grid and Random Search, along with cross-validation, refines model performance. The Gradient Boosting Classifier emerges as the most accurate, achieving an 81% accuracy rate, closely followed by AdaBoost and Random Forest. Cross-validation further validates model generalization. Future work may involve exploring additional feature engineering techniques and experimenting with more sophisticated ensemble methods.
